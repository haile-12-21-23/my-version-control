As a developer working on a project, you first need to pull the project down from a remote repository to your local machine. 
This is commonly called checking out a project or pulling a project. 
Once on your local machine, you can build and run the project and make changes. 
When you're done, you have to push the changes you made back to the remote repository so other developers can see them.

Git workflow are three these are modified, staged and committed.

1. Modified
adding, removing and updating any file inside the repository is considered a modified state.

2. Staged
 Git knows the file has changed, but does not track it. This is where the staging state comes in. Let's turn to it now. In order for Git to track a file, it needs to be put in the staged area.
 Once added, any modifications are tracked. Which offers a security blanket prior to committing the changes.

 3.Committed
 Committing a file in Git is like a save point in many ways. Git will save the file, and have a snapshot of the current changes.

Before I delve into some of the most common commands, it's important to note that each command has a set of helper instructions. 
These helpers give detailed information about how the commands can be run and how something we call flags can be passed. 
One of these helpers is the man command. 
Man is short for manual, and when called against a command, it will display a detailed manual of instructions for that given command.


man command(manual)
man ls => show the detail manual of list command
ls => used to show the content of current working directories
ls command can accept different flags 
example
ls -l => list the files that in write and read order.
ls -a list files in the  directories including the hidden files.


pwd(Print working directories)
pwd shows the full path of the current directories

cp(copy) copying files from one destination to an other destination

mv(move) command moves file from one directories to an other directories

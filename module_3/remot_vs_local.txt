Remote refers to any other remote repository to which developers can push changes. 
This can be a centralized repository, such as one provided by Git hub or repositories on other developer devices.
The remote code is accessed through a URI which is unique and only accessible to those who have permission local. 
On the other hand refers to your machine which can be a laptop, desktop or even a mobile device and is only accessible to you to demonstrate both of these in action.

One of the advantages of it is that you can work offline and then commit your changes when you are ready.
To add remote repository from local
When you use Git Push, Git compares a snapshot of your local repository with the remote one and only replaces the files that have been changed.
